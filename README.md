### Installing the Ask WordPress Plugin

Ask integrates seamless with WordPress. 

First, you have to install Ask on a server, so that the admin and user data can be stored. For install information see https://docs.coralproject.net/products/ask/, and email jeff@mozillafoundation.org if you have any questions. 

When you have Ask installed, follow these instructions:

1. Download the ask-wp-plugin as a zip file by clicking 'Clone or Download' in the top right on this page, then 'Download Zip'
